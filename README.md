> Demonstrates, at very small scale, how a language model is trained.

This repository is part of a series of toy training repositories plus a companion client repository:

- [**Training repositories**](https://github.com/toy-gpt) produce pretrained artifacts (vocabulary, weights, metadata).
- A [**web app**](https://toy-gpt.github.io/toy-gpt-chat/) loads the artifacts and provides an interactive prompt.

## Contents

- a small, declared text corpus
- a tokenizer and vocabulary builder
- a simple next-token prediction model
- a repeatable training loop
- committed, inspectable artifacts for downstream use

## Scope

This is:

- an educational, inspectable training pipeline
- a next-token predictor trained on an explicit corpus

This is not:

- a production system
- a full Transformer implementation
- a chat interface
- a claim of semantic understanding

## Outputs

This repository produces and commits pretrained artifacts under `artifacts/`.

These artifacts are intended to be loaded by the companion client repository.

Typical artifacts include:

- `artifacts/vocab.json`
- `artifacts/weights.csv` (or similar)
- `artifacts/model_meta.json`

Training logs and evidence are written under `outputs/`
(for example, `outputs/train_log.csv`).

## Quick start

See `SETUP.md` for full setup and workflow instructions.

Run the full training script:

```shell
uv run python src/toy_gpt_train/d_train.py
```

Run individual pipeline steps:

```shell
uv run python src/toy_gpt_train/a_tokenizer.py
uv run python src/toy_gpt_train/b_vocab.py
uv run python src/toy_gpt_train/c_model.py
uv run python src/toy_gpt_train/d_train.py
uv run python src/toy_gpt_train/e_infer.py
```

## Command Reference

The commands below are used in the workflow guide above.
They are provided here for convenience.

Follow the guide for the **full instructions**.

### In a machine terminal (open in your `Repos` folder)

After you get a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account,
open a machine terminal in your `Repos` folder:

```shell
# Replace username with YOUR GitHub username.
git clone https://github.com/username/train-600-attention

cd train-600-attention
code .
```

### In a VS Code terminal

```shell
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade

uvx pre-commit install
git add -A
uvx pre-commit run --all-files

# run Python

uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run zensical build

git add -A
git commit -m "update"
git push -u origin main
```

</details>

## Provenance and Purpose

The primary corpus used for training is declared in `SE_MANIFEST.toml`.

This repository commits pretrained artifacts so the client can run
without retraining.
